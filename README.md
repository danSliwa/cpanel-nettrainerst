# Control Panel App for NET-TRAINER-ST



This app was created for the purpose of controlling the NET-TRAINER-ST device, that is more described in this [article](https://publications.waset.org/10012740/pdf), through web-based React application. To use this application, fully operational NET-TRAINER-ST device is required, together with properly configured MQTT protocol connection between the NET-TRAINER-ST and device this application is running on.

This project was part of the master thesis on the topic of "Development of the methodology and implementation of the management system of the ICT networks tester.". Full paper, in Polish language can be found [here](https://polslpl-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/dsliwa_polsl_pl/ERG4800z8rNDjUwlS0drkEsBC6FHvdmt7uLXH7vipn9xUw?e=a0EWXR).
